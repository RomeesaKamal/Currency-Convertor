A simple **Currency Converter** project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to help practice and demonstrate skills in JavaScript, API integration, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

## Features
- Convert between multiple currencies in real-time.
- Fetch live exchange rates using an API.
- Display flags for selected currencies dynamically.
- User-friendly dropdowns for selecting currencies.
- Handles invalid input gracefully by defaulting to 1.

## Learning Objectives
This project was created as part of my journey to learn and practice JavaScript. Key skills demonstrated include:
- Working with **APIs** to fetch live data.
- Manipulating the **DOM** dynamically with JavaScript.
- Managing **events** like button clicks and dropdown changes.
- Using **ES6 modules** to organize code efficiently.
- Debugging and handling API errors gracefully.

## How It Works
1. Users select the base currency and the target currency from dropdown menus.
2. Enter the amount to be converted.
3. Click the "Convert" button to see the converted value along with the appropriate flags.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For basic styling.
- **JavaScript**: For logic, event handling, and API calls.
- **ExchangeRate API**: To fetch real-time exchange rates.
- **Flags API**: To dynamically display country flags.
